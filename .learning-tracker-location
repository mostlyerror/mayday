The learning tracker has been moved to a global location for cross-project use:
~/.claude/LEARNING_TRACKER.md

The learning-tracker skill will automatically find and use this global tracker.

Web Development Learning Track (Next.js/React/TypeScript/Vercel) is tracked in the
"Web Development Learning Track - Mayday Project" section.
